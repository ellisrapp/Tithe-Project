Use Angular to make it into an app format where income input lines can be added and deleted.
If this is done, the output disappears.
The output is triggered by a 'calculate' button press and just displays the total income and other relevant text.

There can be a settings page that the user can (maybe just for fun) switch to dark mode.
And on this settings page they can adjust what percentage of income they want their firstfruits offering to be. 
This will complicate the maths quite a bit and make the various tithe calculation coefficients 
into single variable functions rather than just constants. 

And another information page where the app shows the formulas used in calculation.
